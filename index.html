          Hi, I’m <strong>Sergio Hernandez</strong> (he/him), a bilingual
          (English/Spanish) professional with over 8 years of experience
          supporting teams, planning events, and keeping complex projects
          running smoothly. I’ve worked in everything from executive support and
          B2B logistics to STEM outreach and large public events, and I love
          helping big ideas become reality. I’m especially comfortable in fast
          paced, remote environments where clear communication and flexibility
          are key. Outside of work, I’m a longtime dungeon master and hands-on
          maker, which means I’m used to thinking creatively, adapting quickly,
          and solving problems on the fly. Whether it’s coordinating travel,
          wrangling details, or leading a team through uncharted territory, I’m
          all about making things happen. <br /><br />
